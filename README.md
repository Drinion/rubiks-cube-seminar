# Rubiks Cube Seminar

This implementation was inspired (not copied though! I've suffered too much for that) by stanislavpetrov. The textures have been made by stanislavpetrov.
Simply clone the repo, create an environment and start it (note that the activate suffix depends on your type of shell)
**Note: This setup has only been tested for python 3.7.6. It may be incompatible with other versions***
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate.sh
```
Install the requirements
```
pip3 install requirements.txt
```
Run the application with 
```
python3 scripts/main.py
```
